        Hungry Snake

    <div id="game-description-id">
        <a>The snake moves towards direction of the mouse when the mouse it pressed. When the mouse is not pressed, the
            snake moves in a straight line. So you can change the direction the snake is going by clicking the mouse or
            clicking and moving the mouse at the same time. The snake dies if it moves into the wall or itself. It can
            possible touches itself when taking a very drastic turn larger than 90 degree. It is advised to take
            smooth turns when changing the direction of the snake.
            (make sure you click the mouse in front of the snake!)

            <br />
            <br />

            Scores are calculated based on the number of treats eaten by the snake. When the it eats a treat, its length
            increases by 1.
            The moving speed of the snake also increases as the game goes on.
